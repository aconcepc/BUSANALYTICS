 Alright Guys it's really Hard to know things about a machine in 1-2 days But still if you reading this means you really need an advice.# i bought this Renewed laptop few days back and First product i got wasn't working quite well. So i called technician visit through amazon that too 2 times and guys """""" Amazon technicians  Do Not come instead  they'll want you to lie with customer support. They are worthless. Then i raise complaint with Amazon.AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT Always maintain it's standards and services. they helped me getting a replacement from SYNTRONICS OFFICIAL (seller).I got almost new like laptop Dell e5470 latitude with better Processor i5 6th gen 6440HQ with windows 11 pro and charger. But it was inconvenient why couldn't they send me this one in the first time.Points to remember ---1--- Always look for a good seller (most important)  Search it or do some R&D2-- Use the product even if you don't have to. because then only you would know if there's any problem.3--- Do Not rely on Technician complaint raised by amazon because they'll not do any good. Use amazon customer support instead.4- You may get a used laptop like really used . watch for it.5- it's my first renewed product after replacement i am satisfied so far.6-- Keep one thing in mind if the laptop stops working or showing any symptoms of that after 7 days so you'll have to fix it on your own because i don't they will send someone who could fix it this warranty n all that may not work for you.7--- You have 7 days to judge the product. after that you're on your own almost. (i ordered technical visit 2 times no one came)8- Guys it's worth a shot but for those like me (risk takers)PERFORMANCE---1-- really nice,  this latitude laptop will not disappoint you2-  fine browsing, speed, no heat at all, heavy business work, daily things and rendering also covered.3-- performance wise no complaint so far with REPLACEMENT ONE""4- Everything is original.5-- Screen is really good man..6- this is much much better that those 40k 45k laptops only if you get a fine condition product. litlt luck required.7-- Camara is fine , display awesome, processor powerful8-- i got it for 24k somthing.9- you can't ask much if you get a fine condition laptop in the first time.10-- LOOK FOR THE SELLER PLEASE. Do not order unless you trust the seller. I am thankful to Amazon customer support they helped me get a fine condition laptop.Conclusion ---Wanna save the money, you gotta take a little pain and risk. Make your mind first.",7.2,72.4,20.4,neu

When I opened the package and turned on the laptop it simply said no bootable device found (which meant there was no hard drive in it) I contacted Amazon customer service they filed an investigation on that rather than offering me a refund on return or a replacement and asked me to wait for almost 7-10 working days. Later that day I reached out to the seller he told me to get it checked at Dell store. I went there they opened and checked the hard drive was no properly attached and was loosened. Dell store fixed it I have to pay the charges as it was renewed so they didn't cover it under warranty or so. Later down the week the laptop was not getting turned on ( the motherboard was dead, post verifying it with Dell I reached amazon) I again contacted Amazon customer service they simply said return window is closed no actions can be taken. Without any second doubt without asking and listening to my perspective they slapped resolution on my face that no actions can be taken. The way of communicating this was way too rude!! Amazon has hired a bunch on incompetent individuals who are not capable enough to be in a customer service industry. They're not even following the basic Amazon contact tenets. Long story short I'm still following up with the seller to get it replaced or refunded. Indeed Amazon India services are declining drastically. They're not earth's most customer centric company anymore! It's my humble request to you people please do not buy a renewed product!",9.8,83.2,7,neu

 It has been 5 months since I purchased the laptop. Initially, it had a few minor glitches and now it has become completely non functional. The laptop doesn't start and even if it did start a few times earlier the display was completely distorted. I tried charging the laptop for 4 hours as per the support person's advise but it didn't make any change.I expect a solution for this at the earliest because all my work is getting affected due to this issue.Please do the needful.Thank you",4,91.1,4.9,neu

The screen quality is decent and the setup is convenient. This is running Celeron, so obviously there's no gaming for this machine. It's unfortunate, but that three month game pass is pretty much useless. MS Office setup is easy and straightforward.There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop.",11.3,78.5,10.2,neu

 Laptop is good interms of speed because of SSD and 8Gb ram. All applications runs smooth without LagIts lightweight very light and comfortable to hold and the design is goodBut for me the worst part is display. Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle.  Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen. The TN panel plus the non HD screen makes a good combination for giving you a worst display. If u work on such display for long you will get headaches.I think Lenovo giving so cheap display in 28k product is not done.",11,79.4,9.5,neu

There are hardly any cons in this product.#Built quality is upto the mark.#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.#Processing speed is fluent.#Camera is ok ok (enough).#Touchpad feels premium.#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.#Display quality is more than good in this budget.The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements.

It's light, sufficiently powerful to run office and some light apps with email (i use it as a travel machine, so that is all i need to do with it. If i need to do other coding related work i use it to RDP into my work desktop). I recommended this to four other people two of which are students and use it heavily for taking notes, attending classes etc., and i have not heard them complain once. Excellent battery life.One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case.",6.5,82.5,11.1,neu

LESS NOISE! LESS HEAT!Battery lasts very long 8 hours give or take depending on what you're using it for (videos and streaming naturally will use more battery)Speakers: On the Standard Size, but it is Tablet like, so that is to be expected, sounds like a standard tablet/mobile phone but audio quality is quite crisp and enhanced, but you won't get surround sound deep bass effect.It is not meant for gaming, so don't give it aa bad review if it can't run your favorite games, it is a budget laptop that is extremely mobile, extremely portable 2 in 1 type, perfect for web browsing, video watching, email checking, word processing etc. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my requirements and the screen is absolutely beautiful!

At that price, it’s a real value for money product.Installing android apps is easy through Google play store but initially had some problem setting up Linux.

Linux version is Debian 11 (bullseye), arm64.  Setting up Linux would require some initial knowledge of CLI terminal. After installing Linux, installed software center, GIMP and Libreoffice in it. Was also able to install several other Linux apps by downloading the Debian package. Once installed, Linux apps work just as any other installed apps, though sometimes take 3-4 seconds for initial launch. But for some reason, Wine did not function, so no windows app. The Chrome browser works in full desktop mode.Initially had about 42 GB of free space of which 10 GB had to be given to Linux. Considering the limited storage, files would have to be stored to either Google drive or other online storage. Battery backup is good, about 8-12 hrs, depending upon use. USB-C charger and can be even charged with high wattage mobile chargers. But display is not so crisp, considering the price, that is normal I guess. Keys have good feeling but not backlit.

My last laptop was HP pavilion 15 and served me for 9 yrs and still running. My requirement was to get a laptop which would serve me for long time. I am not a regular game player. So, I looked for all options. Dell G 15 was on cards however when i was doing research I found out that at same price I was getting an i7 12 gen. I ordered this beast. Specs wise it's an i7 12th gen, RTX3050 4 GB, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB ram, 15,6 inch with a 144 Hz refresh rate.

Exchange value was also decent.thanks to amazon for amazing delivery and exchange experience. I got the laptop in 3 days.I am not a professional user of a laptop however as soon as I got it, I edited few Go Pro videos and few dashcam videos. Soon after that I handled video editing for some work. This laptop worked like a breeze. It handled all the huge sized videos with ease. I also used it to project the display onto a data wall and to my surprise, it extended the display instead of normal duplication. It made my work easy as i was able to do my work in background without anyone in audience knowing about it. Till now its a great experience, Battery life is obviously lesser due to i7 and GPU but gaming laptops will have lesser battery life anyway. The display screen is also good. It did not hurt my eyes even after long working on the screen. It looks and feels good. Its not flimsy, it looks very dated and has a good venting and cooling system.

So I did not even dare to try the Turbo mode. More specifically, the issue is that one of the path the heat dissipates through is from right hand side panel near where I keep my mouse. The heat comes directly on the mouse hand.As a solution I have started playing by keeping laptop and chair at 45 degree angle to table.

I have not experienced any thermal throttling despite gaming for 4+ hours continuously. Armory crate profile's can be set up, some come inbuilt to regulate the fan speeds and other settings.WIFI - This comes with WIFI 6, but could have issues with older 2.4 networks.

So if you put the laptop in the bed or lap, the audio quality will be terrible.2) No ethernet. Even though I bought the laptop for my sister who won't be using ethernet/ lan, it feels weird for old school person like me to not have it.3) The usb c port is very close to the charger. I tried the SanDisk dual drive go (the small one) and it fit perfectly though I was a bit uncomfortable plugging and removing it. Bigger ,bulkier devices will be a no go when charger is connected. Similarly I would have liked 2x usb 3, 1x usb 2 instead of the other way around.Other than this , it's a very fine laptop.1) The display is very nice and punches way above it's price point.2) The keyboard is nice, fingerprint is fast.3) The RAM and SSD are of good quality.4) The weight distribution is even which is very important for a compact laptop. Overall build is also satisfactory.5) The battery life is good now, but we'll have to see it holds the same over time.6) The webcam was surprisingly good, didn't expect that.Overall a very good laptop for students who will use it for reading, creating presentations and consuming media.There was a monsoon offer which offered 1 year extra warranty for 99/ 2 year extra warranty for 999. I took the 2 year one to get total of 3 years. With all that, using card offers , it still came under 35k. So a great deal in my opinion.",2.2,84.5,13.3,neu

Build quality is decent for the price, looks are sleek and elegant.  Asus never disappoints with component quality. I checked -both RAM and SSD is from samsung which is great and SSD is NVMe!, So the boot time is blazing fast, boots in 2-3 seconds. Restart is also very quick.14 inch screen size and quality is ok. Bezels are thin around the display. Display is anti glare, Full HD, IPS panel  and has settings for blue light filter as well, so for 14 inch screen, it's good.Sound is not loud but pretty ok if you want to listen to youtube videos etc.It has one USB 3.2 type C  and other USB 3.2 type A port, HDMI on one side and two USB 2.0 ports on the other side of the laptop. though USB type C port doesn't support charging the laptop through it. so if power adapter fails or power port breaks with time, there is no other way to charge the laptop.Cooling system is unique from other laptops and you have to make sure that you aren't blocking the vents, it takes the air in from the bottom vent on right hand side ( FAN is underneath that vent) and the outlet vent is located on the left side! and due to the design of outlet vent also throws the hot air down as well as horizontally to the side, so you have to make sure it's isnt blocked from the bottom side for proper cooling.Those who are getting heating issues, try throttling the CPU in  Control panel > power options > Change plan settings > Change advanced power settings > Processor Power management >  Maximum Processor state - set max power performance to 70% instead of 100% and in MY ASUS app > Customization > Fan profile > choose Performance mode.Keyboard and touchpad are ok  I always good quality external mouse and keyboard.Fingeprint scanner is very quick. It comes preloaded with windows 11 and MS office which is nice.Maximum RAM capacity is only 12GB but you can upgrade storage by adding SSD etc.There is no LAN RJ-45 port so you will have to buy adapter for that if you want to connect LAN cable.Hope this helps someone.",4,83.4,12.5,neu

 This is my first day of using this laptop and already restricted with several shortcomings (comparing to similar priced models) in buying this laptop. I would like to provide my initial findings and I hope my review would help some other potential buyers in deciding whether to buy this model or not1) USB-C is only for data connectivity, no display or charging (thunderbolt) features available. The description of this laptop's feature is purposefully left vague to confuse buyers into buying it. There are few models of this same laptop with these features but not this one.2) User can't upgrade HDD/RAM modules with out voiding warranty. There is a warranty void sticker in the back which voids warranty if the user opened the back panel. I called up acer support and they also confirmed me that owner shouldn't open the back panel if they want to retain warranty. Acer seems to made sure secondary business to service center so that one has to pay for this upgrade service.3) Speaker output seems to be low and not good enough for a gaming laptop.I wish Acer, seller and Amazon to provide open descriptions on their products so that buyers can take an informed decision. I feel I got somewhat misled on the product description on its available features.Comparing with Acer Aspire 5 which has thunderbolt 4 (with display out and usb-c charging), 1240P processor, 2050 RTX GPU. This model is better only in aesthetics, screen refresh rate and may be thermal management, so if you are really going to compare, Aspire 5/7 is a better option to purchase at this price level. This is only my opinion but each individuals preference might differ.Edited after using for 1 month:I got the screen flickering issue that some of the reviewers mentioned here. Initially I thought of contacting Acer support but decided to try some options before that. I have uninstalled the inbuilt VGA driver and restarted Laptop.  Windows automatically installed a new driver for the inbuilt VGA and since that I  didn't see the same issue, hope it fixed the issue. If the issue reoccurs I may have to contact Acer support.One more important thing to consider, never trust the Amazon Pay ICICI card to pay back 5% as reward. They used to pay rewards regularly for few months but when I made high valued purchases they simply held the reward points for few months saying there is some technical glitch and later gave lame reasons for not paying the reward. Whereas when I missed to payment for a few days they calculated interest @42% from the beginning for the previous cycle and charged heftily as interest. Lesson learnt: Never trust credit card company. They make biased mistakes for their benefit",8.9,78.6,12.5,neu

I got it for 49.5k approx during great indian festival sale. And trust me it can satisfy your needs for sure. I do gaming all the time and give me one AAA game i can't play on this machine. I bet you can't. I've used some softwares like for 3D rendering and it never lagged. I've a i5 11th gen 512gb ssd 8GB Ram variant. It has given me a significant performance of 48 fps in cyberpunk and 35 fps in RDR 2. Valorant or Gta 5 100+fps at high settings. Spiderman remastered and miles morales hell yeah 70+ fps on medium setting. The experience is smooth but battery backup is not a thing in this laptop. And  I'm fine with it. I stay at home play games. No problem. But like if you set it on low performance + battery saver it could give 2.5-3 hr backup. And with full power 1 hr.

 The ips panels are of very low quality, my original unit had screen bleed and dead pixels so got a replacement for it, and the latest lap does have screen bleed more than the acceptable level. Another drawback is the speaker volume, the volume is too low to hear.Battery power  only lasted for 2.5 hours while watching a movie at full screen brightness.Pros,Good thermals,Tested with NFS Payback, rise of the tomb raider, ac unity. The maximum cpu temperature was 78°c and GPU 68°c. Most of the time the temperatures were between 60 to 70 while gaming.The gaming performance is also good. Got 50 to  60 fps at 1080p maximum settings for all the 3 games tested.i5 11400h is with GTX 1650 is a good option for gaming at this price range.The reason that I still keeping this laptop is just because of its specs( i5 11400h 6 core 12 thread,) and upgradable capabilities that too under 60k budget. But be aware you can't upgrade urself without voiding the warrenty.So in conclusion, the only good thing that I found with this laptop is 6 core i5 and good thermals, the similar laptops within this price range are still coming with 10th Gen i5 4 core.

Its not Amazon's issue the packaging was outstanding there was no chance to get the device damaged. So I had to reach out to manufacturer ""ACER"" services provided by Acer is very poor technical person was really adamant for not accepting the issue. Even after showing these pictures he said this is normal. I wrote an email and the response I got acer was a link which states ""What causes Backlight Bleeding"" as it was clearly mentioned on their website so I was left with no other option except accepting the device as it is. So my personal suggestion would spend a bit more money and go for a better version and of course no Acer please!! This is because of after service they provide.  After purchasing my laptop I checked the screens of HP pavillion, Asus TUF gaming F17, Lenovo Legion 5, Dell Gaming G5 and didn't find this issue also I had a word with Dell customer service they are really helpful and was able to sense their attention towards a concern.

This is the best laptop for gaming under 65k but there are some pros & cons of this laptop !So considering everything I'll sum up with few points this is good laptop just have to highlight 2-3 things.1 - The battery backup is very poor it hardly stays upto 1.5-2hrs and then will need to plug in for charging so we can continue our work.2 - With this laptop Microsoft office is not provided as freebie will need to buy subscription to work on office works.3 - The sound is not as expected of a gaming laptop also sometimes it has connecting issues with other devices! Overall ignoring above points the laptop is good !,7.7,82.4,9.9,neu

 This is my first day of using this laptop and already restricted with several shortcomings (comparing to similar priced models) in buying this laptop. I would like to provide my initial findings and I hope my review would help some other potential buyers in deciding whether to buy this model or not1) USB-C is only for data connectivity, no display or charging (thunderbolt) features available. The description of this laptop's feature is purposefully left vague to confuse buyers into buying it. There are few models of this same laptop with these features but not this one.2) User can't upgrade HDD/RAM modules with out voiding warranty. There is a warranty void sticker in the back which voids warranty if the user opened the back panel. I called up acer support and they also confirmed me that owner shouldn't open the back panel if they want to retain warranty. Acer seems to made sure secondary business to service center so that one has to pay for this upgrade service.3) Speaker output seems to be low and not good enough for a gaming laptop.I wish Acer, seller and Amazon to provide open descriptions on their products so that buyers can take an informed decision. I feel I got somewhat misled on the product description on its available features.Comparing with Acer Aspire 5 which has thunderbolt 4 (with display out and usb-c charging), 1240P processor, 2050 RTX GPU. This model is better only in aesthetics, screen refresh rate and may be thermal management, so if you are really going to compare, Aspire 5/7 is a better option to purchase at this price level. This is only my opinion but each individuals preference might differ.Edited after using for 1 month:I got the screen flickering issue that some of the reviewers mentioned here. Initially I thought of contacting Acer support but decided to try some options before that. I have uninstalled the inbuilt VGA driver and restarted Laptop.  Windows automatically installed a new driver for the inbuilt VGA and since that I  didn't see the same issue, hope it fixed the issue. If the issue reoccurs I may have to contact Acer support.One more important thing to consider, never trust the Amazon Pay ICICI card to pay back 5% as reward. They used to pay rewards regularly for few months but when I made high valued purchases they simply held the reward points for few months saying there is some technical glitch and later gave lame reasons for not paying the reward. Whereas when I missed to payment for a few days they calculated interest @42% from the beginning for the previous cycle and charged heftily as interest. Lesson learnt: Never trust credit card company. They make biased mistakes for their benefit",8.9,78.6,12.5,neu

I got it for 49.5k approx during great indian festival sale. And trust me it can satisfy your needs for sure. I do gaming all the time and give me one AAA game i can't play on this machine. I bet you can't. I've used some softwares like for 3D rendering and it never lagged. I've a i5 11th gen 512gb ssd 8GB Ram variant. It has given me a significant performance of 48 fps in cyberpunk and 35 fps in RDR 2. Valorant or Gta 5 100+fps at high settings. Spiderman remastered and miles morales hell yeah 70+ fps on medium setting. The experience is smooth but battery backup is not a thing in this laptop. And  I'm fine with it. I stay at home play games. No problem. But like if you set it on low performance + battery saver it could give 2.5-3 hr backup. And with full power 1 hr. But i would recommend it over lenevo or asus or any other acer laptop. It's better then acer aspire 7 i5 12th gen which come in the same budget and let's be honest it's not a legit gaminf laptop it's more like a hybrid. Go for this one.

 The ips panels are of very low quality, my original unit had screen bleed and dead pixels so got a replacement for it, and the latest lap does have screen bleed more than the acceptable level. Another drawback is the speaker volume, the volume is too low to hear.Battery power  only lasted for 2.5 hours while watching a movie at full screen brightness.Pros,Good thermals,Tested with NFS Payback, rise of the tomb raider, ac unity. The maximum cpu temperature was 78°c and GPU 68°c. Most of the time the temperatures were between 60 to 70 while gaming.The gaming performance is also good. Got 50 to  60 fps at 1080p maximum settings for all the 3 games tested.i5 11400h is with GTX 1650 is a good option for gaming at this price range.The reason that I still keeping this laptop is just because of its specs( i5 11400h 6 core 12 thread,) and upgradable capabilities that too under 60k budget. But be aware you can't upgrade urself without voiding the warrenty.So in conclusion, the only good thing that I found with this laptop is 6 core i5 and good thermals, the similar laptops within this price range are still coming with 10th Gen i5 4 core.

I ordered this laptop and screen bleed issue, got it replaced by Amazon received the replacement device on time. But still the issue persist in the replacement. Its not Amazon's issue the packaging was outstanding there was no chance to get the device damaged. So I had to reach out to manufacturer ""ACER"" services provided by Acer is very poor technical person was really adamant for not accepting the issue. Even after showing these pictures he said this is normal. I wrote an email and the response I got acer was a link which states ""What causes Backlight Bleeding"" as it was clearly mentioned on their website so I was left with no other option except accepting the device as it is. So my personal suggestion would spend a bit more money and go for a better version and of course no Acer please!! This is because of after service they provide.  After purchasing my laptop I checked the screens of HP pavillion, Asus TUF gaming F17, Lenovo Legion 5, Dell Gaming G5 and didn't find this issue also I had a word with Dell customer service they are really helpful and was able to sense their attention towards a concern.

It comes with the latest MS Office pre-installed, which is great (not the 365 trial/1-year subscription junk). What I love the most about it though is the weight. I honestly don't care that it's plastic. It is a relief to my arms, shoulder and back. Yes, the screen-size (11"") can be a bit annoying at times, but I bought it for the portability, so I was aware that a compromise will be involved. That said, for the size of the laptop, the keyboard is spectacular. It is one thing that Lenovo does extraordinarily well.Another point in its favour is its price. I am scared of busting up my ""primary"" laptop due to poor electric connections with random voltage surges in places outside of Mumbai. This laptop serves. It is cheap enough for me not to have a heart attack if something fries, and I find myself relying more and more on this cheap dude than my MacBook Pro (i5, 8GB, 512 SSD), which of course is the (significantly) superior machine.Battery life is tolerable - I am not a heavy user, so my battery lasts about 3 days without charge (at about 1-2 hours of use daily). Sound's good too...What I don't like:The screen quality, but hey, its a sub-22k machine (or at least that is what I bough it at.

Don't worry. Go into settings, windows update, and download all updates & restart to install the downloaded updates. This will take some time. Be patient.Second: When all windows updates are installed and the OS is upto date, for the time being, uninstall bloatwares like Prime video, Instagram, WhatsApp, xbox etc. Clean it up as much as possible by removing unnecessary apps. Set up McAfee Live Safe by opening it up from app tray.Third: Most importantly, this machine comes with Windows S mode i.e. you can only download apps from MS Store. If you want a decently fast machine, stay in the S mode. Forget Chrome, use Edge browser built in. Its based on chromium only. If you want to slow the machine down, Google how to get out of S mode.Conclusion: For the price (similar to a chromebook) it is a good laptop for browsing on Edge browser, YouTube, Netflix, Prime video, MS office, MS Teams, Zoom etc. All this can be done in S mode smoothly.Update: At this price point, the keyboard is of really good quality. Typing experience is good. Amongst the chromebooks and Travelmate and other laptops at this price & size, I think this was a good choice for me. Feels premium compared to others and works well for my usecase.",0.7,87.7,11.5,neu

Terrible camera and even more terrible sound output. Heck, my 12 year old Acer Travelmate i3 was much better than this, but let bygones by bygones. Full of bloatware, which makes the  new laptop almost non-functional. MS Office is loaded, which has a 5 day's license. Better not to have provided it. Windows 11 Home edition and Acer junkware further take up computing space. Took a week to update Windows 11 and all drivers. Removed the junkware one by one, including MS Office. Disabled Windows update, removed all crap including a program named Clipchamp. Removed all Acer apps. Still, apps like Agoda and Amazon won't go away. But at least the laptop is responding now. Initially, it just refused to respond, due to tons of unwanted services operating in the background.Hardware wise, nothing wrong. 4GB RAM is upgradable to 12 GB, by adding 8 GB DDR4. But will the warranty become void, if the system is opened now? No answers. At best OK for MS Office 2007 applications and routine surfing. Having a laptop for face value. No great expectations.Update: THIS IS NOT UPGRADABLE TO 12 GB RAM. It has only one slot, occupied with 4 GB stick. That has to be removed and fresh 8GB stick inserted. Also its speed is outdated 2400. Beware!!Windows 11 is hogging 3.5 GB RAM so the laptop is unresponsive most of the time. After upgrading to 8GB, it is responding somewhat.

This slowed down the laptop considerably, using 100% of both the cpu and the disk. The biggest culprit was some random P2P enhance software. Not sure why companies do this, especially if it makes their product unusable.If you have money to spare, go for the SSD version, and a little more ram, it will be much faster.Barring that, the laptop works as intended.Don't expect amazing performance, it will only be good for office or school work, or for watching videos.The image quality is so so, it's not even a 1080p screen, which was disappointing at the price and in this day and age. The colors are not great, might need some calibration, but it'll do for regular use.With only 4gb ram you can't use chrome, best to stick with firefox or any other lightweight browser. If you have the money, upgrade the ram or go for a model with at least 8gb.Upgradability wise, according to the description you can add a m.2 SSD and upto 12gb of ram, which is fair.

So if you put the laptop in the bed or lap, the audio quality will be terrible.2) No ethernet. Even though I bought the laptop for my sister who won't be using ethernet/ lan, it feels weird for old school person like me to not have it.3) The usb c port is very close to the charger. I tried the SanDisk dual drive go (the small one) and it fit perfectly though I was a bit uncomfortable plugging and removing it. Bigger ,bulkier devices will be a no go when charger is connected. Similarly I would have liked 2x usb 3, 1x usb 2 instead of the other way around.Other than this , it's a very fine laptop.1) The display is very nice and punches way above it's price point.2) The keyboard is nice, fingerprint is fast.3) The RAM and SSD are of good quality.4) The weight distribution is even which is very important for a compact laptop. Overall build is also satisfactory.5) The battery life is good now, but we'll have to see it holds the same over time.6) The webcam was surprisingly good, didn't expect that.Overall a very good laptop for students who will use it for reading, creating presentations and consuming media.There was a monsoon offer which offered 1 year extra warranty for 99/ 2 year extra warranty for 999.

Terrible camera and even more terrible sound output. Heck, my 12 year old Acer Travelmate i3 was much better than this, but let bygones by bygones. Full of bloatware, which makes the  new laptop almost non-functional. MS Office is loaded, which has a 5 day's license. Better not to have provided it. Windows 11 Home edition and Acer junkware further take up computing space. Took a week to update Windows 11 and all drivers. Removed the junkware one by one, including MS Office. Disabled Windows update, removed all crap including a program named Clipchamp. Removed all Acer apps. Still, apps like Agoda and Amazon won't go away. But at least the laptop is responding now. Initially, it just refused to respond, due to tons of unwanted services operating in the background.Hardware wise, nothing wrong. 4GB RAM is upgradable to 12 GB, by adding 8 GB DDR4. But will the warranty become void, if the system is opened now? No answers. At best OK for MS Office 2007 applications and routine surfing. Having a laptop for face value. No great expectations.Update: THIS IS NOT UPGRADABLE TO 12 GB RAM. It has only one slot, occupied with 4 GB stick. That has to be removed and fresh 8GB stick inserted. Also its speed is outdated 2400. Beware!!Windows 11 is hogging 3.5 GB RAM so the laptop is unresponsive most of the time. After upgrading to 8GB, it is responding somewhat.

This slowed down the laptop considerably, using 100% of both the cpu and the disk. The biggest culprit was some random P2P enhance software. Not sure why companies do this, especially if it makes their product unusable.If you have money to spare, go for the SSD version, and a little more ram, it will be much faster.Barring that, the laptop works as intended.Don't expect amazing performance, it will only be good for office or school work, or for watching videos.The image quality is so so, it's not even a 1080p screen, which was disappointing at the price and in this day and age. The colors are not great, might need some calibration, but it'll do for regular use.With only 4gb ram you can't use chrome, best to stick with firefox or any other lightweight browser. If you have the money, upgrade the ram or go for a model with at least 8gb.Upgradability wise, according to the description you can add a m.2 SSD and upto 12gb of ram, which is fair.

I have been using it for over a month now and here are my observations.1. Screen: The vertical viewing angle on the screen is not good. Horizontal viewing angles are ok. Once set at a comfortable angle, the screen is good at full HD. Resolution and magnification can be adjusted in settings.2. Battery life: Decent battery life of 4-6 hours. What I do mostly consists of browsing, YouTube, small programming projects and mostly basic tasks and it fulfils my needs.3. Design and build: Loving the all metallic build, even if it is on the heavier side a little. Feels very sturdy.4. Hardware/Software: Windows 11 runs smoothly with i3 11th gen, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. Booting up is fast, within seconds and all actions like app opening and switching are snappy.5. Ports and Connections: carries all the basic ports and connectivity features. So, no issues here.6. Weight: a little on the heavier side but being a 14"" body, it is more convenient to carry than other larger laptops. This is in no way comparable with ultrabooks or light weight notebooks. Availability of all the ports justifies the weight.Overall, if you are in the market for a good laptop that handles basic tasks well, this is a good buy! No complaints so far. You get what you pay for! I have looked around and there are very few good configurations in the 30K - 40K price range. This is one of those few laptops sitting in the range and I believe I made the right choice. Thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery.",2.6,86.1,11.3,neu
